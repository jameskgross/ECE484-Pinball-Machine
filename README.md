# ECE484-Pinball-Machine
Creation of a pinball machine as a learning opportunity for embedded system 

## Features
- Graphical Programming: Utilizes PictoBlox, a versatile graphical programming platform with advanced capabilities.
- Custom Design: Detailed instructions for assembling the playfield, control panel, and scoring system.
- Interactive Gameplay: Features like flippers, bumpers, and score sensors enhance the pinball experience.

## Required Materials
- Hardware
- evive Starter Kit
- MDF Sheets and/or Cardboard Sheets
- IR Sensors
- DC Motors
- RGB LED Strip(optional)
- Limit Switches
- Breadboard and various electronic components (Resistors, Standoffs, Rubber Bands, etc.)
- Jumper Cables
- Plastic toy parts
- Cardboard

## Software
- PictoBlox Software ([Link to download PictoBlox](https://thestempedia.com/product/pictoblox))

## Assembly Instructions
- Step 1: Playfield Design
  Start by decorating the base of your playfield. My design is fairly standard and uses black duct tape. This is also to strenghtne the integrity of the cardboard

- Step 2: Building the Structure
  Assemble the boundary walls, score walls, and control panel according to the diagrams provided. I continued to use duct tape to adhear walls to baseplate

 - Step 3: Electronic Setup
   Install motors for flippers and bumpers, set up the IR sensors for score tracking, and connect the control buttons and RGB LED strips.

 - Step 4: Programming
   Program the gameplay and controls using PictoBlox. The code developed is shown above
